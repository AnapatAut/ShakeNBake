Interactive Cookbook Comments


2023-09-14: Good that you have fleshed out all use case narratives but I think you’re missing some extension scenarios.
2023-09-21: SQL script needs header comment with explanation and author. 

No functional design/flow map?

I recommend that you create subdirectories for design, code, data base, etc.
2023-09-28: Architecture diagram is a bit confusing because I’m not sure what the circles are supposed to be. I would consider revising because everything is going through the App Executive component. I would expect (for instance) for Search to go directly to the database. Also, no module table.
2023-10-04: No coding standards uploaded.

Thank you for adding header comments to your code.

You should not call your source code directory “bin”. This implies that it’s compiled, binary code (which shouldn’t be in the repository anyway). 

What is the purpose of the files in the .idea directory?
